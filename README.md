# password-generator

## Introduction

In this project, I created a password generator. Once a user enters a password length and 
selects from several character types, a random password is generated. The functionality is as follows:

* The user will click a button on a web page to generate a password.
* The user will be prompted to enter a password length between 8 and 128.
* The user will be asked to confirm whether they want to include upper case letters.
* The user will be asked to confirm whether they want to include lower case letters.
* The user will be asked to confirm whether they want to include numbers.
* The user will be asked to confirm whether they want to include special characters.
*
